Welcome to my personal portfolio, created using React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. The website automatically builds and deploys through GitHub Actions whenever new changes are pushed to the main branch.

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my growth and skills acquired over the past three years during my Bachelor's in Software Engineering and Management at Gothenburg University, as I work towards becoming a Junior Developer.
